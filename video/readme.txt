# WEST

## Hi!

If you’d like to take the WEST software for a spin using the pre-existing configuration files, the videos in this folder will make your life easier. Simply copy them into the “video” folder of the test you’ll be using.

They were created for use on an iPod touch and are therefore relatively low resolution, so they will look pretty gnarly on larger screens. This is normal.

Sorry about that lady’s shirt.

Thanks!
