## Hi!

Welcome to Web-Enabled Subjective Test (WEST). For full instructions on use of this software, please download the manual from the [ITS website](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov). Click on “Video Quality Research” and then “Web-Enabled Subjective Test (WEST)”.

WEST is a very simple way to conduct a subjective test on a mobile device. The devices connect to a server running the WEST software using a web browser. The server transfers stimuli to the device, then the device plays the stimulus and prompts the user for a vote.

WEST can be a very useful tool. It is, however, in very early stages of development. With this said, please use caution deploying the system on a Web-facing server. Internet security was not addressed during development of this software.

If you’d like to contribute to the project, please do. The WEST project should be available on GitHub in the near future.

In the mean time, enjoy! Let’s move subjective testing forward.

Thanks!
